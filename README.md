# Google Meet AI Assistant with Audio Bridge

This project provides an AI-powered assistant that can participate in Google Meet sessions using audio bridge technology. The system uses VB-CABLE and Voicemeeter to create a virtual audio pipeline that allows Gemini AI to listen to and respond in Google Meet calls.

## üéØ Overview

The system consists of two main components:

1. **`gemini_audio_only_cable.py`** - The AI assistant that processes audio and responds
2. **`visit_meet_with_audio.py`** - The Google Meet automation that joins meetings

## üîß Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device**
   - Download from: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Install VB-CABLE to create virtual audio devices
   - This creates "CABLE Input" and "CABLE Output" devices

2. **Voicemeeter (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Download from: https://voicemeeter.com/
   - Advanced audio mixing software for better control
   - Provides "Voicemeeter Input" and "Voicemeeter Output" devices

3. **Python Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Google API Key**
   - Set up your Google API key in environment variables:
   ```bash
   set GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## üéµ Audio Bridge Technology

### VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Cable

**VB-CABLE** is a virtual audio device that creates a "cable" between applications:

- **CABLE Input**: Virtual microphone that other applications can use as an audio source
- **CABLE Output**: Virtual speaker that receives audio from applications

**How it works:**
1. Google Meet sends audio to "CABLE Output" (virtual speaker)
2. Our Python script listens to "CABLE Output" (captures Google Meet audio)
3. Gemini AI processes the audio and generates responses
4. Our Python script sends AI responses to "CABLE Input" (virtual microphone)
5. Google Meet receives audio from "CABLE Input" (hears AI responses)

### Voicemeeter Audio Mixer

**Voicemeeter** is an advanced audio mixing application that provides:

- **Multiple audio inputs/outputs**
- **Real-time audio mixing and effects**
- **Better audio routing control**
- **Audio monitoring and recording**

**Benefits:**
- More flexible audio routing
- Better audio quality control
- Advanced mixing capabilities
- Real-time audio monitoring

## üìã Usage Instructions

## üè• Medical Context

The system is configured for medical scenarios, specifically:

- **Patient**: Sarah Miller with DILI (Drug-Induced Liver Injury)
- **EHR Integration**: Access to medical records and lab results
- **Canvas Operations**: Interactive medical dashboard
- **Lab Results**: ALT, AST, Bilirubin, and other liver function tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"CABLE Output device not found"**
   - Ensure VB-CABLE is properly installed
   - Check Windows audio devices in Sound settings
   - Restart the application

2. **"Google API key not set"**
   - Set the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable
   - Verify the API key is valid and has proper permissions

3. **Audio not working in Google Meet**
   - Check Google Meet audio settings
   - Ensure CABLE Input/Output are selected
   - Test audio devices in Windows Sound settings

4. **Chrome profile issues**
   - Run `chrome_profile_manager.py` first to set up profile
   - Check if profile directory exists
   - Verify login credentials are saved

### Audio Device Configuration

**Windows Sound Settings:**
1. Right-click speaker icon ‚Üí "Open Sound settings"
2. Go to "Sound Control Panel"
