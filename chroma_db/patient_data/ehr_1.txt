Diagnostic and Reasoning
Clinical Impression / Working Diagnosis Seropositive Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), active disease. 
Differential Diagnosis (if unclear case)
Psoriatic Arthritis
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)
Crystal Arthropathy (Gout, Pseudogout)
Plan of Management
Investigations: Seropositive RA
Labs: Confirm serologies (RF, anti-CCP if not already done). Baseline CBC, LFTs (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, Bilirubin), Renal Function (Creatinine, eGFR), ESR, CRP. Hepatitis B (HBsAg, Anti-HBc total) and Hepatitis C (Anti-HCV) serologies.
Laboratory & Imaging Results (Structured Tabs) 
  Orders Placed
Labs: RF, Anti-CCP, ESR, CRP, CBC with differential, LFTs (ALT, AST, Alk Phos, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin), Creatinine, eGFR, HBsAg, Anti-HBc Total, Anti-HCV.
   Imaging: N/A   
Diagnosis and Recommended action
Diagnosis and management plans
Diagnosis: Seropositive RA
Medications:
Initiate Methotrexate (MTX) 10mg orally once weekly.
Prescribe Folic Acid 5mg orally once weekly (24 hours after MTX).
Procedures: N/A.
Multidisciplinary input: Education by Rheumatology nurse on RA and MTX.
Education given to patient/family:
Detailed explanation of RA, its chronic nature, and the goals of treatment.
Thorough counseling on Methotrexate: common side effects (nausea, fatigue, mouth sores), rare but serious side effects (liver toxicity, bone marrow suppression, lung toxicity).
Crucial: Emphasize the importance of Folic Acid to mitigate side effects.
Crucial: Strong recommendation to avoid alcohol while on Methotrexate due to increased risk of liver toxicity.
Importance of regular blood tests for monitoring.
Smoking cessation counseling.
Counseling: Reinforce smoking cessation.

Coding and Billing
ICD-10: M05.9 (Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, unspecified).
CPT codes: 99204 (New patient office visit, moderate complexity).
Follow-up Instructions
Return to Rheumatology clinic in 3 months for first follow-up.
Return to GP for interim monitoring blood tests every 4 weeks for the first 3 months, then as advised.
Report any new or worsening symptoms, especially fever, severe fatigue, rash, jaundice, or shortness of breath, immediately to GP or ED.
