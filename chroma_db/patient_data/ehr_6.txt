Visit Type: ED
Date & Time: 2025-06-21 02:00 PM
Clinician: Dr. Sarah Chen
Specialty: Emergency Medicine
Chief Complaint: Severe fatigue, jaundice, epigastric pain, confusion.
History of Present Illness (HPI) Mr. Mc. Allister, a 63-year-old male, presented to ED accompanied by his wife due to sudden onset of severe fatigue, jaundice and epigastric pain over the past 24 hours. His wife reports he started feeling more fatigued and noticed mild mouth ulcers and nausea 4-6 days ago, which they initially attributed to the ongoing infection. He started Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 6 days ago for sinusitis, prescribed by his GP. He has been compliant with all medications. No fever, chills, cough, or urinary symptoms. Denies recent falls or head trauma. No history of similar episodes. Wife denies any new medications or changes to diet.

Diagnostic and Reasoning
Clinical Impression / Working Diagnosis Acute liver injury likely secondary to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) and/or severe methotrexate toxicity.
Differential Diagnosis (if unclear case)
Severe Methotrexate Toxicity (leading to pancytopenia, liver injury, renal injury)
Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole induced DILI
Acute Viral Hepatitis (less likely given history, but cannot be entirely ruled out without serologies)
Acute Liver Decompensation from unrecognized chronic liver disease
Sepsis with multiorgan dysfunction
Plan of Management
Investigations:
Labs: CBC, CMP (full electrolytes, LFTs, renal function), INR/PTT, Ammonia, Methotrexate level (urgent), Hepatitis serologies (HAV, HBV, HCV), Autoimmune panel (ANA, ASMA, LKM), Ceruloplasmin, Alpha-1 antitrypsin, G6PD. Blood cultures.
Imaging: Urgent Abdominal Ultrasound (liver, biliary system).
Laboratory & Imaging Results 
  Orders Placed
Labs: CBC, CMP, INR/PTT, Ammonia, Methotrexate level (urgent), Hepatitis serologies (HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti-HBc IgM, anti-HCV), Autoimmune panel (ANA, ASMA, LKM), Ceruloplasmin, Alpha-1 antitrypsin, G6PD, Blood Cultures x2.
Imaging: Abdominal Ultrasound (STAT).
Diagnosis and Recommended Options
Diagnosis and Management plan
Diagnosis: N/A (Waiting for Labs)
Medications:
Start IV fluids for hydration..
Initiate N-acetylcysteine (NAC) protocol empirically given concern for acute liver failure.
Coding and Billing
ICD-10: K71.1 (Toxic liver disease with hepatic necrosis), T45.1X5A (Adverse effect of antineoplastic and immunosuppressive drugs, initial encounter - for methotrexate), T36.0X5A (Adverse effect of sulfonamides, initial encounter - for TMP-SMX).
CPT codes: 99285 (ED visit, high complexity).
Follow-up Instructions
Patient admitted to ICU/HDU.
Frequent neurological and vital sign monitoring.
Strict input/output.
Immediate notification of critical lab results.
No oral intake until clinical status stable.
